# Sean Liu  |  劉至軒

 I'm Sean, studying Computer Science with a dual degree in Linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. On the computational side, I'm a competitive programmer and an NLP enthusiast - I also enjoy CS & mathematical theory! In linguistics, I'm mostly interested in the digital humanities, especially ancient languages. I'm a bilingual speaker in both Mandarin Chinese and English, and can hold a conversation in Japanese; I've also taken a semester of [Hittite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites) from the wonderful [Prof. Shosted](https://linguistics.illinois.edu/directory/profile/rshosted) at UIUC. I'll be representing team UIUC in the coming ICPC World Finals 2021!
