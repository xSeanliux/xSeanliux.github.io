<small>:camera: NAC ICPC 2022, Team UIUC!</small>
{{< lead >}} who *is* this guy? {{< /lead >}}

 I'm Sean, studying Computer Science with a dual degree in Linguistics at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). On the computational side, I'm a competitive programmer and an NLP enthusiast - I also enjoy CS & mathematical theory! In linguistics, I'm mostly interested in the digital humanities, especially ancient languages. I'm a bilingual native speaker in both Mandarin Chinese and English, and can hold a conversation in Japanese; I've also taken a semester of [Hittite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites) from the wonderful [Prof. Shosted](https://linguistics.illinois.edu/directory/profile/rshosted) at UIUC. I'll be representing UIUC in the coming ICPC World Finals! 

 *What* I'll write here and in *what language* are both TBD - I hope you're as excited as I am for what's to come!
